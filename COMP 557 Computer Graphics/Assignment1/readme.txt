In this project, I have created HingeJoint, BallJoint, MovableJoint( one of the joints 
that can only perform translation) as well as Geometry classes like Box and Sphere.
The character is a girl from Anime, but I think it would be fun to transform it into 
the style of Minecraft. Basicly all the appearance design are from Minecraft with torso,
limbs and head shaped in boxes, so although I created the Sphere class, I did not actually
instantiate it. The structures and possible movements are all human-like, except for the 
design of eyeballs and pupils, in which I set 2D squares to represent them and made it 
possible for pupil translation using the class MovableJoint. 

Other features and designs are shown in the picture and walk-cycle animation, please check them!
