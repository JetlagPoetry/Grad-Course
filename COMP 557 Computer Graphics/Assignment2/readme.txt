In this assignment, I have used glFrustum() function to create eye frustums and draw eye views.
There is not much to mention about Task 1-3.
In task 4 & 5, I made multiple frustums fixed with the gray focal plane, 
while in the left and right eye views, it should be fixed in the screen rectangle.

Also, in former objectives, the eye is looking at point(0, 0, -1).
But in 6-8, eyes are looking toward the negative Z direction.

In left and right eye tasks, I did not make the eyeXOffset and eyeYOffset as factors of the frustum position.
