penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, especially in antarctica. 
highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. 
they spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.
although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as antarctica. 
in fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. 
several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the galapagos penguin, lives near the equator.
the domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.
they are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.
cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.
different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.
